        description: (
            <>
                <p>
                    Retention of Software Engineers is a difficult challenge for teams. In 2023, 37.5% of the Infragistics Reveal Survey said they expect to find it difficult to find developers in 2023. To keep Software Engineers happy, we need to know how to make them unhappy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join me as I talk about antipatterns in management, development, testing and monitoring patterns that can stop you from retaining awesome Software Engineers. Specifically I'll cover:
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Alert volume evaluation, and how we alert bombardment leads to burnout and alert fatigue. I'll also cover best practices for on-call rotation and BYOD usage to stop engineer burnout even when they're not on call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. SLO and metric comparison across teams, and how comparing team metrics rather than improving metrics such as DORA over time for a single team breeds animosity and demoralises engineers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Code reviews with jerkish or unhelpful comments, and the difference between radical candour through constructive feedback and pulling people down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Tool overload, and how selecting a common toolbox reduces the need for context switching.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Flaky or poor testing, and how it builds mistrust and apathy in platform quality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. Constant work items and a lack of learning time, and how a lack of training opportunities and space to grow leaves engineers feeling stuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. Lack of support for conference attendance and speaking, and how community connections help engineers grow and learn.

This talk will chart the course of my career transformation, highlighting the pivotal moments that led me from the sports field to the tech field. Starting with my initial passion for football, I will delve into the lessons of teamwork, discipline, and strategy that I carried into my tech career. The transition could have been more straightforward, but it was filled with challenges, learning curves, and the relentless pursuit of personal and professional growth. As we dive into the tech part of my journey, I'll share how I discovered Kubernetes and why I chose to specialise in building developer self-service platforms. I'll explore the parallels between orchestrating a winning football team and orchestrating containers and services in a cloud-native environment.

Myself, as a subject matter expert in CI/CD, I spent years building the perfect system to mitigate challenges we face at a tech level and business level. Now along comes Dagger, created by Solomon, the founder of Docker, and it makes so many challenges disappear, by design, and opens up so many new possibilties along the way.

                <p>
                    Moving beyond the (chat) box, we will leverage Azure's OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel in .NET to create a custom AI CoPilot for internal applications or data.

                    Tech is at a crisis point. Companies are complaining about a lack of skilled engineers, but won't recruit junior engineers to train up. Agile was designed to improve productivity, but ceremonies are followed ritualistically with little consideration of value. Recruitment often focuses on meaningless trivia rather than preparation for the job at hand.

                    I'm a software developer of almost 15 years standing, progressing from journalism, into we editing and finally into software development. I have worked in the public sector most of my working life, working on projects for the Ministry of Justice, Department for Education as well as countless local authorities and arms length bodies. I am a grade 3 saxophonist, sometime DJ, lapsed homebrewer and tired dad of two (and one dog)

                    My name's Stu and I have ADHD. It's been a blessing and a curse for a good chunk of my life, but I manage it with both coping strategies and medication. However, as I've progressed up the ladder into a tech lead position, I've found I need to adapt how I work to be as effective as possible.
                </p>
                <p>

                    In this talk I'll talk about:

                </p>
                <p>
                    - What ADHD is (and isn't)
                    - My personal history with my diagnosis
                    - How it affects me in my working life
                    - What strategies I used to help me be an effective tech lead

                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm hoping people will come away from this session, not only with an understanding of ADHD as a condition, but also how they can use the strategies I use to help them in their working life, whether they have ADHD or not.

                    AI start taking more and more place in the modern world, however tech leaders forget that most of solutions are for people and users. UCD is kept treated as fringe science when it is solving real live problems and can save a development money or just to avoide investment decision which are undesireble by end users/customers. Now there are a lot of trying to replace UCD practitionaires by AI UCD  which can backfire as AI do not recognise the needs and best practices.

                    At Platform Engineering Day 2024 it was said that “platform engineering is an exercise in software development not operations". This is a simple statement on the surface, but has deep implications.

                <p>
                    The gang of four structural designs such as the facade pattern and architectural evolutions from layered to microservice components are examples of a well documented history of software engineering. Over the decades, not only have the patterns and techniques been captured, but so have the tradeoffs and contexts in which to consider them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software development has a much longer and better documented history than platform building and if we can tap into those experiences we as platform engineers can accelerate our learning and impact. This talk will focus on the key software engineering patterns that appear to be most useful in this new platform building wave so that you too can build not only useful, but also maintainable and extensible platforms.

                    Architectural considerations are often overlooked by developers or completely delegated to a framework. We should start once again discussing how applications are structured, how components are connected and how to lower coupling between different parts of a system, to avoid creating software that cannot easily be maintained or changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The "clean architecture" model predates Robert Martin, who recently brought it back to the attention of the community, and is a way of structuring applications that leverages layers separation and internal APIs to achieve a very tidy, fully-tested, and loosely coupled system.

                    More often than not, front-end developers will focus purely on improving their technical skills. I’m going to show you a better way by demonstrating how you can produce simpler, more resilient codebases by improving your planning & core skills — specifically improving how you provide and receive feedback from designer colleagues.

                    Kathryn loves post it notes, smooth meetings and sharing ideas, and especially loves that Agile offers her all three in her day to day work. Since falling into Scrum mastery by way of a chance training course, Kathryn has chased an Agile way of working across technical and non technical organisations. She is passionate about helping teams find new and better ways of working, that result in a better work life for her team and high quality deliverables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kathryn is a Scrum Alliance certified Scrum Master, and from 2017-2020 ran a meet up for Scrum Masters in Birmingham.  She is currently a Delivery Manager within the NHS, specialising in software implementation within non-technical teams.

                    This is the story of one scrum master, who, fresh from the tech world, came to work with a non-technical team to get them up to speed in Agile. Join me in this case study, as I cover why Agile struck fear into the hearts of the team I joined, how I fell into the jargon trap before working out how to introduce agile concepts successfully, and what working well for us.
